","category":"page"},{"location":"index.html","page":"Introduction","title":"Introduction","text":"Optimal policy search in economics refers to finding policies that maximize or  minimize certain objectives, such as maximizing profit and minimizing costs.  The economic models in this context can be highly complex,  involving numerous variables and parameters. Traditional optimization methods  could be struggled by those models due to their nature of high-dimensionality.  However, Parallel Tempering can be adapted to solve those problems by running  multiple simulations of the economic model with different parameter settings  defined as different temperatures. Therefore, Parallel Tempering has the  potential to be a systematic approach of economic policy search for policymakers. This Julia package aims to utilize the Parallel Tempering algorithm to find  optimal transportation networks.","category":"page"}]
